On this site, you will find my updated personal profile.

The main page identifies information about myself, the portfolio page lists
some projects I have completed, as well as a Weather Station group project.
 The latter incorporates several APIs using jQuery and AJAX, but otherwise it
 is built with HTML, CSS, Javascript and Firebase for the database storage
 and retrieval.

 On the contact page, you will find links for my email, GitHub, LinkedIn and resume.

 Thanks for taking a look.
