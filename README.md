Successful graduate of The Coding Bootcamp at University of Utah with a focus on
HTML/CSS3, JavaScript, MERN stack, mySQL, Heroku, GitHub and more.
Early on in life working in various IT jobs, I always had a desire to cross the big chasm
from hardware and setup support to programming.
Although I enjoyed helping people resolve their issues from a hardware perspective,
coding has always been intriguing to me.

As life happens, I eventually moved down an entirely different career path in healthcare.
I have enjoyed a career for many years as a full-time ICU RN and I decided to create a
new path for myself making a shift to Web Development. As a Registered Nurse I am
able to help many people, but in a different way; primarily in the ICU setting.
Upon completing Bootcamp, Covid-19 was just becoming a known concern in the USA,
indeed the world. As the pandemic worsened with the outcry of some Governors pleading
for healthcare professionals to return to help, I came to the crossroads of continuing my
pursuit of WebDev or continuing to provide my ICU skills in a time of global need.
My sense of duty and compassion drove me to give of myself for that cause, so I decided
to pause my goals of continuing in WebDev and pitch into the fight as a Covid-19 Crisis
Response ICU RN.

Now that things seem to be correcting, I have redirected back to Web Development
refreshing where bootcamp left off. Currently, I have been completing several online
courses including SQL, CSS, JavaScript, node.js, react, etc...
I am looking for an opportunity with an organization that will allow me to grow in my
WebDev pursuit and appreciate the chance to join your team of determined professionals.

MERN stack, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, MySQL,Firebase, Bootstrap, Heroku, GitHub, GitBash...

Thanks for taking a look.
