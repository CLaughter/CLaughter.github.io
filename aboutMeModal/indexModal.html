        <p>
          Successful graduate of The Coding Bootcamp at University of Utah with
          a focus on HTML/CSS3, JavaScript, MERN stack, mySQL, Heroku, GitHub
          and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early on in life working in various IT jobs, I always had a desire to
          cross the big chasm from hardware and setup support to programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I enjoyed helping people resolve their issues from a hardware
          perspective, coding has always been intriguing to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          As life happens, I eventually moved down an entirely different career
          path in Healthcare.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have enjoyed a career for many years as a full-time ICU RN and I
          decided to create a new path for myself making a shift to Web
          Development.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Registered Nurse I am able to help many people, but in a
          different way; primarily in the ICU setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon completing Bootcamp, Covid-19 was just becoming a known concern
          in the USA, indeed the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the pandemic worsened with the outcry of some Governors pleading
          for healthcare professionals to return to help, I came to the
          crossroads of continuing my pursuit of WebDev or continuing to provide
          my ICU skills in a time of global need.
        </p>
        <p>
          My sense of duty and compassion drove me to give of myself for that
          cause, so I decided to pause my goals of continuing in WebDev and
          pitch into the fight as a Covid-19 Crisis Response ICU RN.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that things seem to be correcting, I have redirected back to Web
          Development refreshing where bootcamp left off and dive deep into SQL,
          CSS, JavaScript, node.js, react, etc...
        </p>
        <p>
          I aim to be an expert in a small set of core technologies before
          expanding to the wider net of trends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally from the west coast, I now reside in the Greater SLC, UT
          area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some hobbies I enjoy are playing guitar, fishing and riding my bike.
