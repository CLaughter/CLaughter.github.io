          <p>
            Successful graduate of The Coding Bootcamp at University of Utah
            with a focus on HTML/CSS3, JavaScript, MERN stack, mySQL, Heroku,
            GitHub and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Early on in life working in various IT jobs, I always had a desire
            to cross the big chasm from hardware and setup support to
            programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although I enjoyed helping people resolve their issues from a
            hardware perspective, coding has always been intriguing to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            As life happens, I eventually moved down an entirely different
            career path in Healthcare.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have enjoyed a career for many years as a full-time ICU RN and I
            decided to create a new path for myself making a shift to Web
            Development.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a Registered Nurse I am able to help many people, but in a
            different way; primarily in the ICU setting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon completing Bootcamp, Covid-19 was just becoming a known concern
            in the USA, indeed the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the pandemic worsened with the outcry of some Governors pleading
            for healthcare professionals to return to help, I came to the
            crossroads of continuing my pursuit of WebDev or continuing to
            provide my ICU skills in a time of global need.
          </p>

          <p>
            My sense of duty and compassion drove me to give of myself for that
            cause, so I decided to pause my goals of continuing in WebDev and
            pitch into the fight as a Covid-19 Crisis Response ICU RN.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that things seem to be correcting, I have redirected back to Web
            Development refreshing where bootcamp left off and dive deep into
            SQL, CSS, JavaScript, node.js, react, etc...
          </p>
          <p>
            I aim to be an expert in a small set of core technologies before
            expanding to the wider net of trends.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Originally from the west coast, I now reside in the Greater SLC, UT
            area.

            Some hobbies I enjoy are playing guitar, fishing and riding my bike.
