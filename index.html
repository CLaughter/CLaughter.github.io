      <p><h5>
        Having past experience in the IT industry, I enjoyed working with others to assist in issue resolution. 
        <br>
        During that time, I worked with some self-taught coding, but it was not congruent. I have recently chosen to take on a Web Development Coding Bootcamp. I like the structured approach.

        The Healthcare system requires software and IT technologies as a fundamental aspect of data security to maintain patient information protection (HIPPA).
        <br>
        More specifically, web application integration is increasingly important for the day-to-day charting activities for all personnel, training and proficiency materials distribution and Web-based continuing education.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Registered Nurse working in several hospitals, I have a unique perspective allowing for specialized input relating to the real-world needs of a healthcare professional in a never-ending technologically advancing industry. My objective is to combine my Healthcare and Web Development experience and contribute to easing the increasing complexity associated with technological advancements in industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally from the west coast, I now reside in the SLC, UT area. 
        <br>         
        Some hobbies I enjoy are playing guitar, fishing and riding my bike.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being on an integral part of a dynamic and flourishing team to develop robust and secure web applications is what I am pursuing.
                       
        I enjoy  working on projects utilizing marketable skills I have obtained and realizing the good results therein.
