        <p><h5>
          Successful graduate of The Coding Bootcamp at University of Utah with a focus on HTML/CSS3, JavaScript, MERN stack, mySQL, Heroku, GitHub and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early on in life working in various IT jobs, I always had a desire to cross the big chasm from hardware and setup support to programming. Although I enjoyed helping people resolve their issues from a hardware perspective, coding has always been intriguing to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          As life happens, I eventually moved down an entirely different career path in Healthcare. 
          As a Registered Nurse of many years, I am able to help many people, but in a different way; primarily in the ICU setting. Through the course of it, I experienced a technological need for coding as it relates to the efficiency of the day-to-day routine of nursing staff. 

          <p>
            As a Web Developer and a Registered Nurse, I have a unique perspective allowing for specialized input relating to the real-world needs of the healthcare professional in a never-ending technologically advancing industry.
          </p>

          <p>
          I look forward to being an integral part of a dynamic and flourishing team to develop robust and secure web applications. I have enjoyed working on many projects utilizing the skills I obtained in solo and group environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally from the west coast, I now reside in the Greater SLC, UT area. Some hobbies I enjoy are playing guitar, fishing and riding my bike. Thanks for taking a look at my site.
